# A-NEW-ERA-OF-DATA-ANALYSIS-IN-BASEBALL

There's a new era of data analysis in baseball. Using a new technology called Statcast, Major League Baseball is now collecting the precise location and movements of its baseballs and players. In this project, you will use Statcast data to compare the home runs of two of baseball's brightest (and largest) stars, Aaron Judge (6'7") and Giancarlo Stanton (6'6"), both of whom now play for the New York Yankees.

To complete this project you should be comfortable with pandas and basic data visualization in Python. Check out our Intermediate Python for Data Science and Introduction to Data Visualization with Python courses to get familiar or brush up on your skills.

The dataset used in this project is from Baseball Savant.
